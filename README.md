# MindScribe AI Journal
A personal AI-powered journaling app that helps track emotional wellbeing through smart analysis. Built with React, Vite, Supabase, and Hugging Face.

## Purpose
🌍 Millions of people struggle daily with stress, anxiety, and emotional overwhelm — yet few have an easy way to track how they’re truly feeling over time. Traditional journaling helps, but it often stops at writing thoughts down without deeper reflection.

✍️ MindScribe was created to bridge that gap. By combining the therapeutic power of journaling with the intelligence of AI 🤖, MindScribe not only gives you a private space to write but also provides meaningful insights into your emotional wellbeing.

Each entry is analyzed to highlight stress levels, uncover emotional patterns 💡, and generate supportive reflections tailored to your mood.

The goal is simple: to empower users with clarity, self-awareness, and gentle guidance 🌱 — turning daily journaling into a tool for growth and mental wellness.
